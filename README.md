# vscodedemo

Just a simple demo for learning how to use the Julia programming language on Visual Studio Code and sharing on GitHub.

All the instructions came from a video on The Julia Programming Language YouTube channel.

The video is titled "JuliaCon 2020 | Using VS Code for Julia development | David Anthoff".
